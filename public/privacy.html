<h2> privacy policy</h2>
<p>This policy was last updated september 20, 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="privacy-content">
<h3>What is the purpose of this policy?
</h3>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to explain to you what personal information we collect and how we and our associated companies may use it. Companies are associated with us if they are our subsidiaries or we are both subsidiaries of the same corporate entity.

We are the controller of any personal information that you provide to us, which means that we decide the purposes and means of the processing of that personal information.</p>

</div>
<div class="privacy-content">
<h3>How do we obtain and store your personal information?

</h3>
<p>We obtain your personal information through applications, emails, letters, telephone calls, text messages, cookies, and conversations when you register in our services and work with them (including the personal information gained when you use our learning tools, demo accounts, and trading simulators).

We may monitor or record phone calls with you and monitor (and maintain a record of) all emails and electronic communications we send or receive.

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of the personal information that you have given to us to prevent unauthorised access.</p>


</div>
<div class="privacy-content">
<h3>What types of personal information do we collect and process?
</h3>
<p>We may process the following types of personal information:

name

contact details including email details and phone numbers

age or date of birth

gender

occupation

income

trading knowledge and experience 

user names and passwords

</p>
</div>
<div class="privacy-content">
<h3>How do we check your identity?

</h3>
<p>To comply with money laundering regulations, we need to confirm the name and address of our clients and certain third parties. We may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open your account. Alternatively, we may use a credit reference agency to verify your identity. Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. Our search is conducted with the use of all necessary security measures in order to make sure that the personal information we get is strictly confidential, and unauthorised parties cannot access it.

</p>
</div>
<div class="privacy-content">
<h3>How may we share your personal information?
</h3>
<p>The info we may collect is anonymous and will help us improve your user experience with our mobile application even better!

We may gather info and use a third-party service to understand how you interact with our app, view bugs and crashes, provide customer support, and even enhance or improve your accessibility within the app.

This information is a great benefit to you.

The third-party service we use is Smartlook.com.

To provide those benefits, we sometimes may need to collect and transfer anonymised data, such as the features used in the app, what users are tapping or swiping on, which screenshots are being captured, and identify the virtual device.

Rest assured that none of the anonymous data we may collect involves personal or financial information, other sensitive data, or user-generated private content. Also, any data we may transmit will not include your device's camera, microphone, or other user inputs. All transmitted data are protected by SSL encryption.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="privacy-content mb-0">
<h3>What is the legal basis for our processing of personal information? 

</h3>
<p class="mb-0">The legal basis for our processing of personal information will depend on why we process your personal information.

Where you wish to enter into or have signed a contract to receive services from us, we will process your personal information to enable us to enter into and perform our contract with you. If you do not provide the personal information requested, we may not be able to provide some or all of those services to you.

We may also need to process your personal information to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations including in relation to performing anti-money laundering, terrorism prevention, and sanctions screening checks, complaints, and investigations or litigation.</p>
